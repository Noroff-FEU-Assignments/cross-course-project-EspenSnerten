    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[The answer to the question stated above about how I would advice a potential client is complex, first off we need to look at what the website or app is selling to user, for example, if the site is a simple blog, whose main revenue is the commercial ads put on the site and in the post's themselves the level of security should really only be focused on malware, scripts, and other forms of internet fraud.



      But say you have a e-commerce site or app then it becomes essential to protect the users payment info, so the thing that is difficult with this is the level of protection should not interfere with impulse buys, for example on all bank/stock sites and apps you have what is in my opinion an essential security barrier, namely two factor authentication, we sometimes see this on a e-commerce site, but then it is usual linked up to the bank app itself when you complete a transaction and not the inn-log on the site, it is ingrained in us that when it comes to sites or apps that deals directly with the users portfolio or accounts to want that extra security step, but when we are shopping we want to be able to complete our transaction in very few clicks.
      
      
      
      So the level of security should always be proportional to the users needs, but really in my opinion, two factor authentication and a time limit on passwords I just something we should use and get accustomed to on all sites.]</p>
